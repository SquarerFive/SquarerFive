# SquarerFive

Hey I'm Aiden, a 22-year-old simulation and geospatial intelligence specialist.

I am currently self employed at my own [company](https://starmatrix.io/). The work I do ranges from AI/ML training & integration, design of digital twins for simulation, and the development of software for geoscientific, defense and analytical purposes. Additionally I have also co-founded a startup called VirtuWeather - enabling the realtime 3D visualization of weather across the globe.

I've been interested in space from a very young age, having participated in a NASA competition at 13, relating to soil moisture extraction and even recreating our solar system in Unreal Engine.

My open source projects are being used by many individuals and companies including SpaceX and IAI (Israel Aerospace Industries).
