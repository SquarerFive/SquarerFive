# SquarerFive

Hey I'm Aiden, a 22-year-old simulation and geospatial intelligence specialist.

I am self employed at my own [company](https://starmatrix.io/) doing contract work for clients. The work I do ranges from AI/ML training & integration, design of digital twins for simulation, and the development of software for geoscientific, defense and analytical purposes. Additionally I have also co-founded a startup called VirtuWeather - enabling the realtime 3D visualization of weather across the globe.

I've been interested in space from a very young age, having participated in a NASA competition at 13, relating to soil moisture extraction and even recreating our solar system in Unreal Engine.

My open source projects are being used by individuals from companies & gov including SpaceX and IAI.

Interested in consultations? Contact me at aiden@starmatrix.io
